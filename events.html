        <h3>Glen Allen Elementary School</h3>
        <p>February 13, 2024</p>
      </div>
      <p>At our next school, our focus shifted to an energetic group of third graders. We kicked off with the foundational lesson introducing them to the basics of computers, encryption, and decryption â€“ building a solid tech foundation from the start.</p>
      <p>Taking a tailored approach, we seamlessly integrated our curriculum with the school's Standards of Learning (SOL). The result? An engaging 'Around the World' activity where students were assigned continents and embarked on a coding adventure using block coding and Scratch. Witnessing their creativity flourish as they crafted fun facts sheets, we celebrated the powerful fusion of computer science with their existing curriculum.</p>
      <p>This unique combination not only enriched their coding skills but also served as a dynamic supplement to their education. We're thrilled to be part of their learning journey, enhancing their educational experience for a brighter and more interconnected future.</p>

        <h3>Gayton Elementary School</h3>
        <p>January 30, 2024</p>
      </div>
      <p>Gayton Elementary School was kind enough to host the very first Code Critters workshop. This was a great experience with a fantastic group of fourth-grade and fifth-grade students.</p>
      <p>Together, we delved into the inner workings of computers along with encryption and decryption. These young minds enthusiastically participated in a hands-on encryption-decryption activity, gaining a firsthand understanding of cybersecurity basics.</p>
      <p>Expanding upon this experience, the students were also introduced to basic coding through Python, sparking curiosity and igniting their passion!</p>
      <p>Check out pictures from this experience that capture the pure curiosity, joy, and moments of discovery for these budding computer science enthusiasts!</p>
